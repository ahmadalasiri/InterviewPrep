## Key Concepts

### Scalability

**Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)**

- Add more resources (CPU, RAM) to existing servers
- Simpler to implement
- Limited by hardware constraints
- Single point of failure

**Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)**

- Add more servers to distribute load
- Better fault tolerance
- More complex to implement
- Virtually unlimited scaling

### Performance Metrics

- **Throughput**: Requests per second (RPS)
- **Latency**: Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- **Availability**: Uptime percentage (99.9%, 99.99%)
- **Consistency**: Data consistency guarantees
- **Durability**: Data persistence guarantees

### Design Principles

#### 1. Separation of Concerns

- Keep different functionalities independent
- Makes system easier to understand and maintain

#### 2. Single Responsibility

- Each component should have one clear purpose
- Easier to scale and debug

#### 3. Fail Fast

- Detect and handle errors early
- Use timeouts and circuit breakers

#### 4. Eventual Consistency

- Accept temporary inconsistencies for better availability
- Use when strong consistency is not required

#### 5. Idempotency

- Operations can be repeated safely
- Critical for distributed systems

### CAP Theorem

You can only guarantee 2 of 3:

- **Consistency**: All nodes see same data at same time
- **Availability**: Every request receives a response
- **Partition Tolerance**: System continues despite network failures

**Common Choices:**

- **CP Systems**: MongoDB, HBase, Redis (prioritize consistency)
- **AP Systems**: Cassandra, DynamoDB, CouchDB (prioritize availability)
- **CA Systems**: Traditional RDBMS (not truly distributed)

### Load Balancing Algorithms

1. **Round Robin**: Distribute requests sequentially
2. **Least Connections**: Send to server with fewest active connections
3. **Least Response Time**: Send to fastest server
4. **IP Hash**: Route based on client IP address
5. **Weighted Round Robin**: Distribute based on server capacity
6. **Geographic**: Route based on client location

### Caching Strategies

1. **Cache-Aside**: Application manages cache manually
2. **Write-Through**: Write to cache and database simultaneously
3. **Write-Behind**: Write to cache first, sync to database later
4. **Read-Through**: Cache loads data from database automatically
5. **Refresh-Ahead**: Proactively refresh cache before expiration

### Cache Eviction Policies

- **LRU** (Least Recently Used): Evict oldest unused item
- **LFU** (Least Frequently Used): Evict least accessed item
- **FIFO** (First In First Out): Evict oldest item
- **TTL** (Time To Live): Evict based on expiration time

### Database Patterns

#### Sharding Strategies

1. **Range-Based**: Shard by value ranges
2. **Hash-Based**: Shard by hash of key
3. **Geographic**: Shard by location
4. **Entity-Based**: Shard by entity type

#### Replication Patterns

1. **Master-Slave**: One write node, multiple read nodes
2. **Master-Master**: Multiple write nodes
3. **Multi-Master**: Distributed writes with conflict resolution

## Best Practices

### 1. Design Principles

- **High Cohesion**: Keep related functionality together

### 2. Reliability

- **Redundancy**: Eliminate single points of failure
- **Monitoring**: Track metrics and logs
- **Alerting**: Detect and respond to issues quickly
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain partial functionality during failures
- **Disaster Recovery**: Have backup and restore procedures

### 3. Security

- **Authentication**: Verify user identity (OAuth, JWT)
- **Authorization**: Control access to resources (RBAC, ABAC)
- **Encryption**: Protect data in transit (TLS) and at rest
- **Input Validation**: Prevent injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and DDoS

### 4. Performance

- **Caching**: Reduce database load
- **CDN**: Serve static content from edge locations
- **Database Indexing**: Speed up queries
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use queues for long-running tasks
- **Compression**: Reduce bandwidth usage

### 5. Maintainability

- **Code Reviews**: Ensure quality and knowledge sharing
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and load testing
- **Monitoring**: Track system health and performance
- **Versioning**: Manage API versions carefully

## Common System Design Patterns

### 1. Database Patterns

- **CQRS**: Separate read and write operations
- **Event Sourcing**: Store state changes as events
- **Database per Service**: Each microservice has its own database
- **Saga Pattern**: Manage distributed transactions

### 2. Communication Patterns

- **Request-Response**: Synchronous communication (HTTP, gRPC)
- **Publish-Subscribe**: Asynchronous event-driven (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- **Remote Procedure Call**: Call remote functions (gRPC)
- **Webhooks**: HTTP callbacks for events

### 3. Resilience Patterns

- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures
- **Retry Pattern**: Retry failed operations
- **Timeout Pattern**: Fail fast on slow operations
- **Bulkhead**: Isolate resources to prevent total failure
- **Rate Limiting**: Control request rate

### 4. Observability Patterns

- **Health Check**: Monitor service health
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralize logs (ELK stack)
- **Distributed Tracing**: Track requests across services (Jaeger)
- **Metrics**: Collect and visualize metrics (Prometheus, Grafana)

## Capacity Estimation Examples

### Example 1: Twitter-like System

**Assumptions:**

- 200 million daily active users (DAU)
- Each user posts 2 tweets per day on average
- Each user reads 20 tweets per day
- Average tweet size: 140 bytes + metadata = 200 bytes

**Calculations:**

- **Tweets per day**: 200M × 2 = 400M tweets/day
- **Tweets per second**: 400M / 86400 = ~4,600 tweets/second
- **Read requests per second**: 200M × 20 / 86400 = ~46,000 reads/second
- **Storage per day**: 400M × 200 bytes = 80 GB/day
- **Storage per year**: 80 GB × 365 = ~29 TB/year

### Example 2: URL Shortener

**Assumptions:**

- 100 million shortened URLs created per month
- 10:1 read to write ratio
- URLs stored for 10 years
- Average URL size: 100 bytes

**Calculations:**

- **Write requests per second**: 100M / (30 × 86400) = ~38 writes/second
- **Read requests per second**: 38 × 10 = 380 reads/second
- **Storage needed**: 100M × 12 months × 10 years × 100 bytes = ~1.2 TB
- **Cache size** (20% of reads): 100M × 10:1 × 0.2 = 200M URLs = 20 GB
