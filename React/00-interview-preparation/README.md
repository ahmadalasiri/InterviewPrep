## üöÄ Quick Reference

### Component Basics

```jsx
// Functional Component
function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
}

// With State
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

### Common Hooks Patterns

```jsx
// useState
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);

// useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect
  return () => {
    // Cleanup
  };
}, [dependencies]);

// useContext
const value = useContext(MyContext);

// useReducer
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

// useCallback
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b]);

// useMemo
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

// useRef
const inputRef = useRef(null);
```

### React Patterns

```jsx
// HOC Pattern
const withAuth = (Component) => {
  return (props) => {
    const isAuthenticated = useAuth();
    return isAuthenticated ? <Component {...props} /> : <Login />;
  };
};

// Render Props
<DataProvider render={(data) => <Component data={data} />} />

// Compound Components
<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>Tab 1</Tab>
    <Tab>Tab 2</Tab>
  </TabList>
  <TabPanels>
    <TabPanel>Content 1</TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>Content 2</TabPanel>
  </TabPanels>
</Tabs>
```

### Performance Optimization

```jsx
// React.memo
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(Component);

// useMemo
const expensiveValue = useMemo(() => {
  return expensiveCalculation(data);
}, [data]);

// useCallback
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(id);
}, [id]);

// Code Splitting
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./Component"));

<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
  <LazyComponent />
</Suspense>;
```
