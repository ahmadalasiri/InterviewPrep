## üöÄ Quick Reference

### Node.js Command Line Tools

```bash
# Run a Node.js file
node app.js

# Run with debugging
node --inspect app.js

# Run with environment variables
NODE_ENV=production node app.js

# Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Format code
npm run format

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Run with nodemon (auto-restart)
npx nodemon app.js
```

### Common Node.js Patterns

- **Callback Pattern**: Traditional async handling
- **Promise Pattern**: Chainable async operations
- **Async/Await**: Modern, synchronous-looking async code
- **Event Emitter**: Pub/sub pattern for events
- **Middleware Pattern**: Chain of responsibility (Express)
- **Singleton Pattern**: Single instance modules
- **Factory Pattern**: Creating objects dynamically
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
