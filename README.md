## 🎯 Featured Topics

### TypeScript: Interface vs Type

One of the most asked TypeScript interview questions! Check out our comprehensive guide:

- [TypeScript Interview Questions](Typescript/00-interview-preparation/01-basic-questions.md#q1-what-is-the-difference-between-interface-and-type-in-typescript)
- [Practical Examples](Typescript/01-basics/interface-vs-type.ts)

**Quick Summary:**

- **Interface**: Better for object shapes, classes, and declaration merging
- **Type**: Required for unions, tuples, primitives, and advanced type operations

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Choose your topic from the directory structure
2. Start with `00-interview-preparation` folders for interview-focused content
3. Review practical examples in numbered folders
4. Check `resources.md` files for additional learning materials

## 📖 Structure

Each topic follows this structure:

```
Topic/
├── 00-interview-preparation/    # Interview Q&A
├── 01-basics/                   # Fundamental concepts
├── 02-advanced/                 # Advanced topics
├── README.md                    # Topic overview
