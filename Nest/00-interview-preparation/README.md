### Common Decorators

**Class Decorators:**
- `@Module()` - Define a module
- `@Controller()` - Define a controller
- `@Injectable()` - Define a provider
- `@Catch()` - Define exception filter
- `@WebSocketGateway()` - Define WebSocket gateway

**Method Decorators:**
- `@Get()`, `@Post()`, `@Put()`, `@Delete()`, `@Patch()` - HTTP methods
- `@UseGuards()` - Apply guards
- `@UseInterceptors()` - Apply interceptors
- `@UsePipes()` - Apply pipes
- `@UseFilters()` - Apply filters

**Parameter Decorators:**
- `@Req()`, `@Request()` - Request object
- `@Res()`, `@Response()` - Response object
- `@Param()` - Route parameters
- `@Query()` - Query parameters
- `@Body()` - Request body
- `@Headers()` - Request headers

### NestJS Architecture Patterns

- **Modular Architecture**: Organize code into feature modules
- **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling and testability
- **Separation of Concerns**: Controllers, Services, Repositories
- **DTO Pattern**: Data Transfer Objects for validation
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access layer
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic module creation
- **Strategy Pattern**: Guards, interceptors, pipes
- **Observer Pattern**: Event emitters and listeners
