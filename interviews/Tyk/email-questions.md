Subject: Re: Application for Mid-Level Full-Stack Engineer (React + Go) - Tyk

Hi Michal,

Thank you for considering my application.

Why Tyk
I’m very interested in Tyk because of its strong focus on building open source, developer-friendly API management tools that are used globally. I admire how Tyk combines technical innovation with a transparent, remote-first culture, and I’d be excited to contribute to a team that is shaping how APIs are managed at scale.

Why this role
The Full-Stack Engineer role is a great match for my background. I have experience building scalable backend services (Node.js, Go) and rich front-end applications (React, TypeScript). I enjoy working across the stack, especially on projects that combine performance, usability, and developer experience. This role looks like an opportunity to apply my skills in both areas, while also learning and growing with a team that values engineering excellence.

I’d be glad to provide any additional details you need. Looking forward to the next steps!

Best regards,
Ahmad Mostafa

Hi Michal,

Thanks for getting back to me. I’d love to share why I’m interested in Tyk and this role.

Why Tyk
A few things make Tyk stand out to me. First, the fully remote setup really fits how I like to work — I’ve been working remotely for a while and it’s where I do my best work. Second, I checked reviews on Glassdoor and noticed that people tend to stay at Tyk for years, which says a lot about the culture. Third, I really like that Tyk is open source — contributing to open-source projects has always been a personal goal. And finally, I can see Tyk as a place where I’d learn a lot from talented teammates, which is really important to me.

Why this role
This role lines up well with my skills. I have strong experience in backend development with Go and Node.js, and frontend with React.js and Next.js. I’ve also handled DevOps tasks in some projects, so I’m comfortable working across the stack. Still, backend is where I feel strongest.

Overall, I see this role as a great chance to contribute meaningfully while also learning and growing. I’d be excited to join Tyk and help build tools that support developers everywhere.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Ahmad Mostafa
