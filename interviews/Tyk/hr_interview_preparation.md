## **Part 2 — HR Interview Questions With Answers (Tailored to Your CV)**

### **1. Tell me about yourself.**

I’m a backend-focused full-stack engineer with strong experience building scalable SaaS platforms, distributed processing pipelines, and API-driven systems using Go, Node.js, and React. I’ve been working fully remote for years with international teams, delivering products end-to-end — from architecture to deployment. I enjoy solving complex system problems, improving performance, and working in environments that value autonomy and ownership, which is why Tyk resonates with me.

### **2. Walk me through your career journey.**

I started freelancing early, which helped me learn to take full ownership of projects. Then I worked at TechBridge Lab, where I focused on distributed video pipelines, integrations, and large system migrations. After that, I joined TIXAE.AI, where I delivered AI-powered SaaS platforms, billing systems, and real-time collaboration features. Overall, my experience shaped me into someone who can deliver reliable systems, move fast, and own features end-to-end — which aligns with this role.

### **3. Why are you interested in joining Tyk?**

Because Tyk works on world-class API infrastructure, which is exactly where my passion lies. I’ve worked with APIs, integrations, distributed workers, and webhooks extensively, and I’d love to contribute to a platform that connects systems at a global scale. I also really appreciate Tyk’s remote-first culture and focus on autonomy — it fits my work style perfectly.

### **4. Why this role specifically?**

The role combines exactly what I enjoy: building clean, performant React frontends and reliable Go backend services. I already use both technologies in production, and the API Gateway + Dashboard ecosystem is a space I’m deeply interested in. I want to work on a product that developers rely on every day.

### **5. What motivates you most?**

Building products that matter and seeing real impact. I enjoy solving complex problems, improving system performance, and making things more efficient. Working in an environment that values autonomy and trust also motivates me to perform my best.

### **6. Where do you see yourself in a few years?**

I see myself becoming a stronger system-level engineer, contributing to large distributed architectures and leading technical decisions for critical product areas. I want to grow inside a company long-term.

### **7. Why are you looking for a new opportunity?**

I’m looking for a place where the engineering culture prioritizes ownership, clean architecture, and distributed systems. Tyk fits exactly that direction and offers the environment where I can grow and contribute more deeply.

### **8. How do you manage your time remotely?**

I plan my day around deep-work blocks, async communication, and clear task breakdowns. I rely on tools like Notion/Jira and keep my focus on completing outcomes, not just staying online.

### **9. How do you stay productive remotely?**

By organizing my work in small deliverables, documenting everything clearly, communicating proactively, and reducing distractions. I’ve been working remotely for years, so remote-first workflows are natural to me.

### **10. Describe your ideal remote workday.**

A mix of focused coding sessions, async communication, reviewing or documenting tasks, and collaborating when needed. I prefer clear priorities and minimal meetings.

### **11. How do you collaborate across time zones?**

I over‑communicate in writing, share context proactively, leave detailed updates, and make sure no one is blocked. I’m flexible when needed for important sync calls.

### **12. A conflict Example.**

In one project, a teammate and I had different opinions on a migration timeline. I suggested aligning on clear milestones and load-testing results. After discussing openly, we agreed on a middle ground and delivered successfully. Open communication solved it quickly.

### **13. How do you handle feedback?**

I welcome feedback because it improves the product and my skills. I also give feedback in a constructive, respectful, and specific way.

### **14. Explaining technical topics.**

In Rakad’s project, I explained geospatial matching to non-technical stakeholders using simple visuals and real-life examples so they could understand the system logic without technical details.

### **15. What role do you take in a team?**

I naturally take ownership roles — handling backend design, integrations, and end-to-end delivery. I’m proactive, supportive, and prefer clarity and structure in communication.

### **16. Full ownership example.**

PastPal’s billing system: I handled architecture, Stripe integration, webhooks, subscription logic, error handling — everything from zero to production.

### **17. A mistake you made.**

I once deployed a migration that caused performance issues. I quickly rolled back, added metrics, identified the bottleneck, fixed the query, and communicated transparently. It reinforced the importance of staged rollouts.

### **18. How do you prioritize tasks?**

Impact first: what affects users, deadlines, and dependencies. Then I break tasks into small units to deliver continuously.

### **19. Working independently.**

Most of my freelance and remote work was fully independent — from architecture to deployment and client communication. I’m very comfortable working without micromanagement.

### **20. Radical responsibility.**

It means owning outcomes, not just tasks. If I say I’ll deliver something, I take responsibility for the quality, the communication, the testing, and the result.

### **21. Most challenging project.**

The distributed video processing pipeline at TechBridge Lab. It involved concurrency, SQS workers, multiple AI integrations, and heavy FFmpeg operations. It taught me a lot about reliability and scaling.

### **22. Tight deadlines.**

During the Agrivoz system launch, we had to deliver the interviewer workflow quickly. I prioritized essential features, kept communication clear, and delivered ahead of schedule.

### **23. Learning something quickly.**

I learned Gin and Go concurrency patterns quickly to build distributed workers at TechBridge Lab.

### **24. What do you know about Tyk?**

Tyk is an API management platform used globally by major companies. You follow a remote-first culture, value autonomy, and expect engineers to take ownership. The mission of connecting systems worldwide aligns with my experience.

### **25. Most important value in a remote-first company?**

Trust — supported by clear communication, accountability, and autonomy.

### **26. Why should we choose you?**

Because I combine strong backend engineering skills with end-to-end ownership, remote experience, API expertise, and a deep passion for distributed systems. I can contribute quickly and reliably.

### **27. Availability.**

I can start on 1 December 2025.

### **28. Salary expectations.**

I’m flexible and open to discussing a fair number based on the role and market.

### **29. Questions for them.**

- How does Tyk define success for this role in the first 3 months?
- How does the engineering team collaborate across time zones?
- What are the biggest challenges the team is currently facing?
- During your experience at Tyk, have you done any layoffs at Tyk to reduce costs at any time?
