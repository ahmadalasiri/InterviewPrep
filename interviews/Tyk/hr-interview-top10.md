## Top 10 Questions with Answers

**1. Tell me about yourself and your background.**

I'm a Software Engineer with approximately 3 years of experience, mainly in backend development. I have hands-on experience designing and delivering scalable, high-performance systems using Golang, Node.js, and React. The last company I worked at was TIXAE.AI, where I worked as a Full Stack Engineer developing AI-powered solutions. Before that, I worked at TechBridge Lab on multiple SaaS projects including DubbingHub, an AI-powered video dubbing platform, and Feedbq.io, an enterprise feedback management platform. I also have extensive freelance experience delivering end-to-end solutions for many clients from Canada, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, including e-commerce platform, ERP systems, and backend services for many mobile applications.

**2. Why are you interested in working at Tyk specifically?**

A few things make Tyk stand out to me. First, the fully remote setup really fits how I like to work — I've been working remotely for a while and it's where I do my best work. Second, I looked at reviews on Glassdoor and was impressed — people describe Tyk as a great place to work, with a positive culture, and many of them stay for years. That says a lot about the environment and stability. Third, I really like that Tyk is open source — contributing to open-source projects has always been a personal goal. And finally, I can see Tyk as a place where I'd learn a lot from talented teammates, which is really important to me.

**3. What attracted you to this Mid-Level Full-Stack Engineer role?**

This role lines up well with my skills. I have strong experience in backend development with Go and Node.js, and frontend with React.js and Next.js. I've also handled DevOps tasks in some projects, so I'm comfortable working across the stack. Still, backend is where I feel strongest. I enjoy working across the stack, especially on projects that combine performance, usability, and developer experience. This role looks like an opportunity to apply my skills in both areas, while also learning and growing with a team that values engineering excellence.

**4. What's your experience with remote work?**

I've been working remotely for all my professional roles. At TIXAE.AI, I worked remotely with a team based in Florida, United States. At TechBridge Lab, I worked remotely with a US-based team. All my freelance projects have been remote, working with international clients. This experience has taught me how to communicate effectively, manage my time, stay motivated, and deliver results without needing to be in an office. I'm very comfortable with the remote work model and have consistently delivered high-quality work in remote settings.

**5. What has been your proudest moment or biggest achievement in your career so far?**

One of my proudest moments was leading a database migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL using Drizzle ORM at Feedbq.io. This was a critical project that required careful planning and execution. I achieved zero downtime and 100% data integrity during the migration, which was essential for a production system serving enterprise clients. This project required deep understanding of both database systems, careful data transformation, and coordination with the team to ensure no service interruption. The successful completion of this migration significantly improved the system's reliability and performance.

**6. Tell me about a time you made a significant impact in the workplace.**

At Feedbq.io, I implemented a Redis caching layer with TTL strategies and cache invalidation that reduced API response times by 60%, from 800ms to 320ms. This had a direct impact on user experience and system performance. These optimizations weren't just technical improvements—they directly translated to better user satisfaction and system scalability.

**7. What are your career goals for the next 2-3 years?**

In the next 2-3 years, I want to deepen my expertise in full-stack development, particularly in Go and React. I'd like to take on more architectural responsibilities and contribute to system design decisions. I'm also interested in contributing to open-source projects, which aligns with Tyk being open source. I want to continue learning from experienced engineers and eventually mentor others. Working at a company like Tyk would help me achieve these goals by providing opportunities to work on challenging problems and learn from a talented team.

**8. How do you handle autonomy and self-direction in your work?**

I thrive with autonomy. I'm self-motivated and can work independently while staying aligned with team goals. I take initiative to identify what needs to be done and prioritize effectively. I communicate proactively so others know what I'm working on, and I ask for help when needed. I've worked in environments with high autonomy, including freelance work, and I've proven I can deliver results without micromanagement. I appreciate having the freedom to find the best way to solve problems. This aligns well with Tyk's principle of "radical responsibility" where employees are trusted to manage their work effectively.

**9. What questions do you have for me about Tyk or the role?**
