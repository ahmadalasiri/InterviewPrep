## Top 10 Questions with Answers

**1. Tell me about yourself and your background.**

I'm a Software Engineer with approximately 3 years of experience, mainly in backend development. I have hands-on experience designing and delivering scalable, high-performance systems using Golang, Node.js, and React. The last company I worked at was TIXAE.AI, where I worked as a Full Stack Engineer developing AI-powered solutions. Before that, I worked at TechBridge Lab on multiple SaaS projects including DubbingHub, an AI-powered video dubbing platform, and Feedbq.io, an enterprise feedback management platform. I also have extensive freelance experience delivering end-to-end solutions for many clients from Canada, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, including e-commerce platform, ERP systems, and backend services for many mobile applications.

**2. Why are you interested in working at Tyk specifically?**

There are several reasons why I'm very interested in Tyk. First, I'm looking for stability, and that's exactly what I found at Tyk. When I researched the company, I read reviews on Glassdoor where most people describe Tyk as a great place to work. I also checked many LinkedIn profiles of people at Tyk, and I noticed that most of them have been there for years, which says a lot about the stability and positive work environment at Tyk. Second, the fully remote setup aligns perfectly with how I like to work — almost all my previous experience, whether freelancing or full-time in companies, was remote, and it's where I do my best work. Third, I really like that Tyk is open source — contributing to open-source projects has always been a personal goal for me. Finally, I can see Tyk as a place where I'd learn a lot from talented teammates, which is really important to me.

**3. What attracted you to this Mid-Level Full-Stack Engineer role?**

This role lines up well with my skills. I have strong experience in backend development with Go and Node.js, and frontend with React.js and Next.js. I've also handled DevOps tasks in some projects, so I'm comfortable working across the stack. Still, backend is where I feel strongest. I enjoy working across the stack, especially on projects that combine performance, usability, and developer experience. This role looks like an opportunity to apply my skills in both areas, while also learning and growing with a team that values engineering excellence.

**4. What's your experience with remote work?**

I've been working remotely for all my previous roles. At TIXAE.AI, I worked remotely with a team distributed across the United States, UK, Turkey, and Egypt. All my freelance projects have been remote, working with clients from Canada, Germany, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. This experience has improved my communication skills, time management, and ability to deliver results without needing to be in an office.So I'm very comfortable with the remote work model.

**5. How do you handle working with different time zones?**

At TIXAE.AI, we ensured we were all available for at least 5 hours of overlapping time to collaborate effectively. I'm always available to collaborate with the team if anyone needs anything, and I'm comfortable adjusting my work hours to ensure sufficient overlap for real-time collaboration.

**6. What has been your proudest moment or biggest achievement in your career so far?**

One of my proudest moments was leading a database migration from MongoDB to PostgreSQL using Drizzle ORM at Feedbq.io. This was a critical project that required careful planning and execution. I achieved zero downtime and 100% data integrity during the migration, which was essential for a production system serving enterprise clients. This project required deep understanding of both database systems, careful data transformation, and coordination with the team to ensure no service interruption. The successful completion of this migration significantly improved the system's reliability and performance.

**7. Tell me about a time you made a significant impact in the workplace.**

At Feedbq.io, I implemented a Redis caching layer with TTL strategies and cache invalidation that reduced API response times by 60%, from 800ms to 320ms. This had a direct impact on user experience and system performance. These optimizations weren't just technical improvements—they directly translated to better user satisfaction and system scalability.

**8. What are your career goals for the next 2-3 years?**

In the next 2-3 years, I want to deepen my expertise in full-stack development, particularly in Go and React. I'd like to take on more architectural responsibilities and contribute to system design decisions. I'm also interested in contributing to open-source projects, which aligns with Tyk being open source. I want to continue learning from experienced engineers and eventually mentor others. Working at a company like Tyk would help me achieve these goals by providing opportunities to work on challenging problems and learn from a talented team.

**9. How do you work independently?**

I work well on my own. I'm self-motivated and can manage my work without constant supervision. I figure out what needs to be done, prioritize tasks, and keep the team updated on my progress. I ask for help when I need it. I've worked in freelance and company roles where I had a lot of independence, and I've shown I can deliver results without being micromanaged. This matches Tyk's "radical responsibility" approach where people are trusted to manage their own work.

**10. What questions do you have for me about Tyk or the role?**

- What do you enjoy most about working at Tyk?
- How would you describe Tyk's culture and what makes it unique?
- What does a typical day or week look like for this role?
- What are the main projects or initiatives the team is working on?
- How does the team typically collaborate in a remote setting?
- What does career growth look like for engineers at Tyk?
- How does onboarding work for new engineers?
- How does Tyk define success for this role in the first 3 months?
- How does the engineering team collaborate across time zones?
- What are the biggest challenges the team is facing right now?

**11. When would you be available to start?**

I prefer if i can start from the beginning of the next month, but i'm flexible and can start earlier if needed.
