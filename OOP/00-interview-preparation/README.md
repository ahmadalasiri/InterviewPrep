- Practice class design and relationships
- Understand access modifiers and visibility

### Week 3-4: SOLID Principles

- Study each SOLID principle with examples
- Identify violations in code
- Practice refactoring to follow SOLID

### Week 5-6: Design Patterns

- Learn creational patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder)
- Study structural patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Facade)
- Master behavioral patterns (Observer, Strategy, Command)

### Week 7-8: Practice

- Solve coding challenges
- Design class hierarchies
- Implement design patterns
- Code review exercises

## Tips for Success

1. **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Focus on understanding concepts rather than memorizing definitions
2. **Practice Coding**: Implement concepts in your preferred language
3. **Real-World Examples**: Prepare examples from your own projects
4. **Draw Diagrams**: Practice drawing UML class diagrams
5. **Explain Clearly**: Practice explaining concepts as if teaching someone else
