## 🎓 Interview Strategy

### Before the Interview

1. **Review Fundamentals**: Focus on complexity analysis and common patterns
2. **Practice Communication**: Explain solutions out loud
3. **Set Up Environment**: Test your coding environment beforehand
4. **Rest Well**: Get good sleep the night before

### During the Interview

1. **Understand the Problem**

   - Ask clarifying questions
   - Confirm inputs, outputs, constraints
   - Work through 1-2 examples

2. **Plan Your Approach**

   - Discuss brute force first
   - Identify optimization opportunities
   - Explain time/space complexity

3. **Write Code**

   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Think out loud

4. **Test Your Solution**

   - Walk through with example
   - Check edge cases
   - Identify potential bugs

5. **Optimize if Needed**
   - Discuss trade-offs
   - Implement improvements

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Jumping into code without understanding
- ❌ Not asking clarifying questions
- ❌ Ignoring edge cases
- ❌ Poor variable naming
- ❌ Not explaining thought process
- ❌ Getting defensive about mistakes
- ❌ Not testing the code

## 💡 Key Concepts to Master

### Pattern Recognition

- **"Find pair/triplet"** → Two Pointers or Hash Map
- **"Substring/subarray"** → Sliding Window
- **"Connected components"** → DFS/BFS or Union Find
- **"Shortest path"** → BFS (unweighted) or Dijkstra (weighted)
- **"Optimize/count ways"** → Dynamic Programming
- **"Generate all possibilities"** → Backtracking
- **"Greedy choice"** → Greedy Algorithm

### Complexity Intuition

- Nested loops → O(n²) or worse
- Single loop → O(n)
- Divide in half → O(log n)
- Sorting → O(n log n)
- All subsets → O(2ⁿ)
- All permutations → O(n!)
