## 🚀 Quick Reference

### Common JavaScript Methods

```javascript
// Array methods
map(), filter(), reduce(), find(), findIndex()
forEach(), some(), every(), includes()
push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), splice()
slice(), concat(), join(), flat(), flatMap()

// String methods
split(), slice(), substring(), substr()
trim(), trimStart(), trimEnd()
toUpperCase(), toLowerCase()
includes(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf()
replace(), replaceAll(), match(), search()

// Object methods
Object.keys(), Object.values(), Object.entries()
Object.assign(), Object.freeze(), Object.seal()
Object.create(), Object.defineProperty()
hasOwnProperty(), Object.prototype.toString()
```

### JavaScript Patterns

- **Module Pattern**: Encapsulation with closures
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven programming
- **Singleton Pattern**: Single instance
- **Factory Pattern**: Object creation
- **Prototype Pattern**: Inheritance
- **Revealing Module Pattern**: Public API with private implementation

### Time Complexity

```javascript
// O(1) - Constant
const first = arr[0];

// O(n) - Linear
arr.forEach(item => console.log(item));

// O(n²) - Quadratic
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
    // nested loop
  }
}

// O(log n) - Logarithmic
// Binary search

// O(n log n)
// Efficient sorting (merge sort, quick sort)
```
