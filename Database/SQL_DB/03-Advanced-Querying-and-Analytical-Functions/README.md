# 03 - Advanced Querying and Analytical Functions

Moving beyond basic retrieval to complex data analysis and transformation.

## Topics
- **Views**: Standard views, Indexed (Materialized) views, and security implications.
- **Subqueries**: Correlated and non-correlated subqueries.
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Recursive and non-recursive CTEs.
- **MERGE Statement**: Combining INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.
- **Ranking Functions**: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), NTILE().
- **Window Functions**: OVER(), PARTITION BY, ORDER BY, LAG(), LEAD(), FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE().
- **Pivot & Unpivot**: Transforming rows to columns and vice versa.
- **Analytical Queries**: Cumulative sums, moving averages.

## Senior Engineer Considerations
- Views vs. Materialized Views: Trade-offs in storage and fresh data.
- Performance implications of subqueries vs. joins vs. CTEs.
- Effective use of window functions for complex reporting.
- Writing readable and maintainable complex queries.
