# 03 - Advanced Querying and Analytical Functions

Moving beyond basic retrieval to complex data analysis and transformation.

## Topics
- **[Views and Materialized Views](./views-materialized.md)**: Virtual vs. Physical abstractions.
- **[Window Functions](./window-functions.md)**: Ranking, Analytical, and Value functions.
- **[CTEs and Recursive Queries](./ctes-recursive.md)**: Modular SQL and hierarchical data.
- **[UPSERT and MERGE](./upsert-merge.md)**: Efficient data synchronization.

## Senior Engineer Considerations
- Impact of Materialized View refresh on application performance.
- Window functions vs. Self-joins.
- CTE materialization boundaries in Postgres 12+.
