# 01 - Database Design and Modeling

Focus on the foundational principles of how databases are structured and planned.

## Topics
- **DB Life Cycle**: Requirements analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance.
- **Database Design**: Conceptual, logical, and physical design.
- **ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)**: Modeling entities, attributes, and relationships.
- **EERD (Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram)**: Specialization, generalization, and categorization.
- **Normalization**: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, and beyond. Understanding anomalies.
- **File Based System vs. DBMS**: Evolution and advantages of modern database systems.
- **DB Systems Architecture**: Schema (Conceptual, Internal, External), Mapping, and data independence.

## Senior Engineer Considerations
- Trade-offs between normalization and performance (denormalization).
- Modeling for scalability and extensibility.
- Domain-driven design (DDD) influence on database schema.
