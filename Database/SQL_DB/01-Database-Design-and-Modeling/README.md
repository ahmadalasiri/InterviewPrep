Focus on the foundational principles of how databases are structured and planned.

## Topics
- **[Database Life Cycle](./db-lifecycle.md)**: Requirements, Design, Implementation, and Maintenance.
- **[Normalization Deep Dive](./normalization-deep-dive.md)**: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF and Denormalization.
- **[ERD Best Practices](./erd-best-practices.md)**: Modeling entities and relationships effectively.
- **[Architecture and Independence](./architecture-independence.md)**: The 3-schema architecture and data independence.

## Senior Engineer Considerations
- Trade-offs between normalization and performance.
- Domain-driven design (DDD) influence on schema.
