# 04 - Programmability and Logic (T-SQL)

Extending SQL with procedural logic and automated responses.

## Topics
- **Variables & Flow Control**: DECLARE, SET, IF/ELSE, WHILE, CASE statements.
- **Stored Procedures**: Input/output parameters, error handling (TRY...CATCH).
- **Triggers**: AFTER and INSTEAD OF triggers. Best practices and pitfalls.
- **User Defined Functions (UDFs)**: Scalar, Inline Table-Valued, and Multi-Statement Table-Valued functions.
- **Cursors**: Use cases, performance issues, and set-based alternatives.
- **Transactions in Code**: Explicit vs. implicit transactions, Savepoints.

## Senior Engineer Considerations
- Stored procedures vs. ORMs (e.g., Prisma, Drizzle).
- Avoiding "RBAR" (Row-By-Agonizing-Row) processing.
- Error handling strategies and logging in database logic.
- Side effects of triggers and debugging challenges.
