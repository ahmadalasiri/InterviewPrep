# 06 - Performance Optimization and Indexing

Techniques to ensure the database handles high load and complex queries efficiently.

## Topics
- **Indexing**: Clustered vs. Non-clustered, covering indexes, filtered indexes, columnstore indexes.
- **Index Maintenance**: Fragmentation, rebuilding, and reorganizing.
- **Execution Plans**: Reading and interpreting graphical and XML plans.
- **Statistics**: Importance of up-to-date statistics for the optimizer.
- **Query Tuning**: Identifying bottlenecks, slow queries, and missing indexes.

## Senior Engineer Considerations
- Index design for read vs. write workloads.
- Troubleshooting parameter sniffing and plan regressions.
- Wait statistics and identifying resource contention.
- Monitoring tools and performance baselining.
