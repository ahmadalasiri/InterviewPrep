# 05 - Database Engine and Internals

Understanding how the database works under the hood to write better queries and designs.

## Topics
- **DB Engine Architecture**: Query optimizer, storage engine, buffer manager.
- **SQL Server Services**: Management and configuration.
- **Storage Internals**: Pages, extents, heaps, and B-Trees.
- **Transact-SQL (T-SQL)**: Dialect specifics and engine processing.
- **Memory Management**: Buffer pool and cache mechanisms.

## Senior Engineer Considerations
- Understanding how the optimizer chooses an execution plan.
- Impact of physical storage layout (SSD vs. HDD, partitioning).
- Log-structured merge-trees (LSM) vs. B-Trees (general knowledge).
- Data compression and its impact on CPU and I/O.
