## Topics
- **[PostgreSQL Constraints](./constraints.md)**: Guarding data integrity.
- **[Join Algorithms](./join-algorithms.md)**: Nested Loop, Hash, and Merge joins.
- **[Grouping and Aggregates](./grouping-aggregates.md)**: GROUP BY, HAVING, and advanced groupings.
- **[Set Operators](./set-operators.md)**: UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT.

## Senior Engineer Considerations
- Index-aware join optimization.
- Impact of `work_mem` on Hash and Merge joins.
- Set-based thinking vs. Procedural thinking.
