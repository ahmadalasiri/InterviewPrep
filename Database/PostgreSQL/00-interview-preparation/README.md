## üöÄ Quick Reference

### PostgreSQL Commands

```bash
# Connect to database
psql -U username -d database

# Common psql commands
\l                  # List databases
\c database_name    # Connect to database
\dt                 # List tables
\d table_name       # Describe table
\du                 # List users
\q                  # Quit
```

### Common SQL Patterns

```sql
-- Basic SELECT
SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE age >= 18;

-- JOIN
SELECT u.name, p.title
FROM users u
INNER JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id;

-- GROUP BY
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(price) as avg_price
FROM products
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;

-- Subquery
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM orders WHERE total > 1000);

-- CTE
WITH active_users AS (
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active'
)
SELECT * FROM active_users WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Window Function
SELECT name, salary,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) as rank
FROM employees;
```

### Prisma Examples

```javascript
// Find many with where
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: { age: { gte: 18 } },
  include: { posts: true },
});

// Create with nested relations
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: "test@example.com",
    posts: {
      create: [{ title: "Post 1" }, { title: "Post 2" }],
    },
  },
});

// Transaction
await prisma.$transaction([
  prisma.user.create({ data: { email: "user1@example.com" } }),
  prisma.post.create({ data: { title: "Post 1", userId: 1 } }),
]);
```

### Drizzle Examples

```javascript
// Select with where
const users = await db.select().from(usersTable).where(gte(usersTable.age, 18));

// Insert
await db.insert(usersTable).values({ email: "test@example.com", name: "John" });

// Update
await db.update(usersTable).set({ name: "Jane" }).where(eq(usersTable.id, 1));
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Practice Daily** - Write at least one SQL query per day
2. **Use EXPLAIN** - Understand query execution plans
3. **Read Documentation** - Official docs are the best resource
4. **Study Real Schemas** - Look at production database designs
5. **Understand Trade-offs** - Know when to denormalize
6. **Build Projects** - Create applications using PostgreSQL
7. **Learn psql** - Master the command-line tool
8. **Know Your ORM** - But also understand the SQL it generates

## Common Interview Mistakes to Avoid

1. ‚ùå Not understanding the difference between WHERE and HAVING
2. ‚ùå Forgetting to add indexes on foreign keys
3. ‚ùå Using SELECT \* in production code
4. ‚ùå Not understanding N+1 query problems
5. ‚ùå Ignoring NULL handling in queries
6. ‚ùå Not considering transaction isolation levels
7. ‚ùå Overusing JOINs when subqueries would be better
8. ‚ùå Not validating SQL injection prevention

## Sample Interview Questions Preview

**Question:** "Write a query to find the top 5 customers by total order amount"

**Good Answer:**

```sql
SELECT
  c.id,
  c.name,
  SUM(o.total) as total_spent,
  COUNT(o.id) as order_count
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Question:** "How would you optimize a slow query?"

**Good Answer:**

1. Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand the query plan
2. Check if indexes are being used
3. Create appropriate indexes on WHERE/JOIN columns
4. Consider query rewriting (e.g., JOIN vs subquery)
5. Look at table statistics (ANALYZE command)
6. Check for sequential scans on large tables

**Good luck with your PostgreSQL interview! üçÄ**

Remember: Understanding both SQL fundamentals and your chosen ORM is key to success!
